This is a proof-of-concept space shooter 2D game for testing several components of the [Xethya framework](https://github.com/xethya). It uses [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) too! :)

## Components used

- **xethya-dice:** Used for random-related actions (damage levels, spawners, etc.)
- **xethya-entity:** Every element on stage is either a `SkilledEntity` or a plain, basic `Entity`.
